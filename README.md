# Portfolio---Data-Analysis--Energy-Usage
This Portfolio is about the data analysis on predicting the energy usage of a house based on IoT measurements of temperature and humidity and weather observations. 

This portfolio is a work on the research paper http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.083 that has been reproduced here in Python with the below steps:

1. Reading certain data files ![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)`energydata_complete.csv`, ![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)`energydata_testing.csv` and ![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)`energydata_training.csv`.
2. Visualizing data for various months / weeks based on energy data consumption.
3. Fitting a linear regression model to the data to calculate evaluation metrics and use of RFE.
